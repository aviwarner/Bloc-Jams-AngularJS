# Problem
There are a ton of music players out there. Most do a pretty good job. Of course, it’s tough to decide what to play with so much selection. My goal was to build a functional, responsive music player that cut through all the garbage out there and just focused on playing a single, great album.

# Solution
First pass at building the site relied on vanilla Javascript. It was a great exercise, and an excellent learning opportunity to dive into event listeners. The site was refactored using jQuery, with some added functionality thrown in beyond the original specifications (e.g. hiding the play bar until the first song is playing). Music playing is built on the Buzz library.
